# University-Industry Collaboration Project

## Requirements
This project is a collaboration between **NCKU Data Analytics Club** and **KDAN Mobile Taiwan**, aiming to enhance **membership management and marketing strategies** through data analysis and machine learning.  

### Technologies Used:
- **Python** (Data analysis and machine learning)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Data processing and visualization)
- **Random Forest** (Machine learning model)
- **NAPL Segmentation Model** (New, Active, Potential, Lost, SealedReady)

> **Note**: Due to corporate data confidentiality, this project does not include the original dataset.

### Environment Setup:
Ensure Python is installed, then run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Usage:
- **Launch Jupyter Notebook**
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
- **Train the Machine Learning Model**
```bash
python src/train_model.py
```
